However, the rapid growth of the internet and resulting growth of “fake news” and “fake research” has contributed to a credibility crisis (McGee and Dawson 2020). Scientific transparency and reproducibility are essential to increasing (and restoring, in some cases) credibility of scientific research. Part of the solution to this crisis is to increase the use of open science (OS) practices. OS refers to a suite of best practices, approaches, and tools that can be used to conduct and share research. The goal of OS is to enhance the transparency of research workflows and reproducibility of scientific findings (Munafò et al. 2017; Elliott and Resnik 2019). This course will review the current state of OS, why it is important, and the challenges and benefits of implementing OS. The course will also discuss workflows and programs that can facilitate implementing OS – including code and data best practices, data provenance, sharing research, and document creation.

Room TBD. 3.2 Course objective The objective of this course is to provide an overview of OS and an introduction to the tools that can be used to facilitate practicing OS during graduate research and beyond. 3.3 Course format The course will consist of student-led paper discussions, lectures, and student computer exercises. A final project will focus on using tools and workflows to create an OS project template that can be used for future projects. 3.4 Tentative course outline (primary themes to cover) What is open science and reproducible research? Readings: (Powers and Hampton 2019; Alston and Rick 2021) Is there an OS/science credibility problem? Readings: (Baker 2016; Mandeville et al. 2021) Why now? Why is reproducible research important? Readings: (Light et al. 2022; Munafò et al. 2017) Addressing open science and data privacy concerns Readings: (Zipper et al. 2019) Challenges and benefits of implementing OS Readings: (Allen and Mehler 2019; Bahlai et al. 2019; Fleming et al. 2021) Obligations/requirements for federally funded projects Best practices for reproducible code Readings: (Wilson et al. 2017; Filazzola and Lortie 2022) Practicing OS (Stodden, Leisch, and Peng 2014) Open data Open source Open access Open standards Open data, data provenance Metadata Data releases Data and code repositories Zenodo, Dryad, ScienceBase, RunMyCode, etc. Reproducible research life-cycle: document generation systems (including data analysis), version control, collaborate, communicate, educate Tools of the trade RStudio GitHub Markdown LaTex Overleaf Final project The final project is an opportunity for students to work through most of the workflow and tools discussed above to create a template for use during their graduate research and beyond. The project will include using Git with RStudio and using markdown and LaTeX to create a document – a fully reproducible report, manuscript, etc. References "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
